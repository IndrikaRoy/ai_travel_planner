        "Master the NYC subway; it's the fastest way to travel. Purchase a MetroCard or use contactless payment directly at turnstiles.",
        "Tipping is customary: expect to tip 15-20% for table service, taxi drivers, and bartenders. For quick counter service, a dollar or two is appreciated.",
        "Always be aware of your surroundings, especially in crowded tourist areas and on the subway. Keep valuables secure and avoid flashing large amounts of cash.",
        "Cash is useful for street vendors and small bodegas, but credit/debit cards are widely accepted everywhere. ATMs are plentiful.",
        "Visit popular attractions like the Empire State Building or the Statue of Liberty early morning (before 9 AM) or late afternoon/evening to avoid peak crowds and long lines.",
        "While NYC has its own slang, most locals speak standard English. 'Fuhgeddaboudit' is more of a stereotype; focus on being polite and direct.",
        "Pack comfortable walking shoes \u2013 you'll walk miles! Dress in layers, as indoor AC can be cold and outdoor temperatures can fluctuate significantly.",
        "Explore diverse neighborhoods beyond Midtown and Times Square. Areas like the Lower East Side, DUMBO in Brooklyn, or Astoria in Queens offer unique experiences with fewer tourists."
