This remaining amount is highly unrealistic to cover all other trip components. Strict budget management, prioritizing public transit over car rentals or frequent ride-shares, and significantly adjusting expectations for other trip components (like choosing very budget-friendly accommodation and cooking meals) will be essential to stay within this budget. Consider increasing the budget for a more comfortable trip."

    "localTips": [
        "Always greet with 'Bonjour' (or 'Bonsoir' after 6 PM) when entering shops or addressing someone, and 'Merci' (thank you) when leaving. A little French goes a long way!",
        "Master the Metro: It's the fastest way to get around. Purchase a 'carnet' of 10 tickets for flexibility, or a Navigo D\u00e9couverte pass if staying for a full week (Monday-Sunday).",
        "Be highly vigilant against pickpockets, especially in crowded tourist areas like the Eiffel Tower, Louvre, and on the Metro. Keep valuables secure in a cross-body bag or front pocket.",
        "Visit popular attractions right at opening time (early morning) or in the late evening to avoid the largest crowds. Weekdays are generally less busy than weekends.",
        "Comfortable walking shoes are essential. Paris is a city best explored on foot, and you'll easily log miles each day.",
        "Savor the Parisian pace: Don't rush meals, enjoy the 'terrasse' culture. Tipping is usually rounding up or leaving a few euros for good service, as service is typically included.",
        "Explore beyond the main sights: Wander through local markets (like March\u00e9 des Enfants Rouges), stroll along Canal Saint-Martin, or discover the hidden courtyards of Le Marais for an authentic experience.",
        "When paying with a credit card, always choose to be charged in Euros (\u20ac) if given the option, to avoid unfavorable dynamic currency conversion rates."
