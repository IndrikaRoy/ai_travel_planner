The lower end of the flight estimate ($2500) would leave approximately $1000 for car rental and local transit, which is manageable. However, if flights approach the higher end ($3500), the budget will be fully consumed by airfare alone, leaving no funds for ground transportation. Achieving the lower flight estimates will require significant flexibility in airline choice, layovers, and booking extremely far in advance (ideally 10-12 months prior). Consider adjusting expectations for flight comfort or exploring alternative departure points if the budget proves too restrictive."
