        "Always queue patiently, speak softly on public transport, and refrain from eating/drinking on trains. Get an IC card (Suica/Pasmo) for seamless travel on subways and JR lines, and use Google Maps for navigation.",
        "Cash is still king in many places; always carry yen and utilize ATMs at 7-Eleven, FamilyMart, or Lawson convenience stores, which are ubiquitous and reliable.",
        "Learn essential phrases like 'Arigato gozaimasu' (Thank you) and 'Sumimasen' (Excuse me/Sorry). While many signs are in English, a translation app will enhance your experience.",
        "Visit popular attractions early mornings or on weekdays to avoid peak crowds. The shoulder seasons (late May/early June, October) offer pleasant weather with fewer tourists than the cherry blossom or autumn foliage peaks.",
        "Tokyo is remarkably safe, but be mindful in crowded nightlife districts. Embrace convenience stores (konbini) like 7-Eleven or FamilyMart for ATMs, quick meals, drinks, and clean restrooms.",
        "Pack comfortable walking shoes, a portable Wi-Fi device/eSIM, and a universal adapter (Japan uses Type A/B, 100V). Layers are advisable due to varying indoor/outdoor temperatures.",
        "Tipping is not customary in Japan and can be considered impolite. Also, remember to remove your shoes when entering homes, traditional restaurants, temples, and certain changing rooms."
