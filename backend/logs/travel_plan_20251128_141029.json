        "Always greet shopkeepers, cafe staff, and even strangers you interact with using 'Bonjour' (or 'Bonsoir' after dusk) and a 'Merci, au revoir' when leaving. It's a fundamental courtesy that goes a long way.",
        "The Metro is your best friend for getting around Paris. Purchase a 'carnet' of 10 tickets for convenience and a slight discount, and always validate your ticket before boarding.",
        "Be highly aware of pickpockets, especially in crowded tourist areas like the Eiffel Tower, Louvre, Montmartre, and on the Metro. Keep bags securely closed and valuables out of sight.",
        "Credit and debit cards are widely accepted. Tipping is appreciated but generally not expected to be as high as in the US; rounding up the bill or leaving a few euros for good service is common.",
        "Visit major attractions like the Louvre, Eiffel Tower, and Notre Dame area either right at opening time or in the late evening to avoid the largest crowds and long queues.",
        "Learn a few basic French phrases: 'Bonjour' (hello), 'Merci' (thank you), 'S'il vous pla\u00eet' (please), 'Pardon' (excuse me). Parisians appreciate the effort, even if you switch to English afterward.",
        "Pack comfortable walking shoes \u2013 you'll walk miles exploring the city's charming streets. Also bring layers as Parisian weather can be unpredictable, and a universal travel adapter.",
        "For a more authentic experience, explore beyond the main tourist hubs. Wander through the Marais, visit a local market like March\u00e9 des Enfants Rouges, or enjoy a picnic along the Canal Saint-Martin."
