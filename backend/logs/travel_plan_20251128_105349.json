        "Purchase an IC card (Suica or Pasmo) upon arrival for seamless travel on trains and subways; it's also accepted at many vending machines and convenience stores. Use Google Maps for real-time navigation.",
        "While credit cards are increasingly accepted, cash is still king, especially for smaller shops, market stalls, and some traditional eateries. ATMs at 7-Eleven or Japan Post offices are your best bet.",
        "For popular spots like Shibuya Crossing or Senso-ji Temple, visit early morning on weekdays to avoid peak crowds. Sakura (cherry blossom) season in late March/early April is beautiful but expect huge crowds and higher prices.",
        "Learn a few basic phrases like 'Arigato gozaimasu' (Thank you) and 'Sumimasen' (Excuse me/Sorry). Even a little effort goes a long way and is greatly appreciated by locals.",
        "Pack comfortable walking shoes as you'll be doing a lot of exploring. An umbrella or light rain jacket is wise for unexpected showers, and layers are good for varying temperatures.",
        "Don't underestimate the convenience store (konbini) for delicious, affordable meals, snacks, and drinks. They are also excellent for ATMs and basic amenities.",
        "Tokyo is one of the safest cities in the world. While general awareness is always good, you can generally feel very secure exploring day or night, even in less crowded areas."
