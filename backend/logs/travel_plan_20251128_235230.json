        "Dress modestly, especially when visiting religious sites, and remove your shoes before entering. Always use your right hand when giving or receiving items.",
        "The best time to visit is October to March for pleasant weather. Visit popular attractions early in the morning or late afternoon to avoid crowds and the heat.",
        "While English is widely spoken, learning 'Namaste' (hello/goodbye) and 'Dhanyawad' (thank you) in Hindi or Marathi shows respect and can enhance interactions.",
        "Embrace the street food culture, but choose vendors with visible hygiene and high footfall. Vada Pav, Pani Puri, and Pav Bhaji are essential culinary experiences.",
        "Pack light, breathable cotton clothing and very comfortable walking shoes. A reusable water bottle, sunscreen, and a hat are indispensable for Mumbai's climate."
