        "Service is always included in restaurant bills, but it's customary and appreciated to round up or leave an extra few euros for excellent service.",
        "Pack comfortable walking shoes; you'll be doing a lot of exploring on foot. Layers are also key for Paris's often unpredictable weather.",
