        "Be highly vigilant against pickpockets, especially in crowded tourist hotspots like the Eiffel Tower, Louvre, Montmartre, and on busy M\u00e9tro lines. Keep valuables out of sight and secure.",
        "While service is included, leaving a small tip (a few euros for a good meal, or rounding up for a coffee) for exceptional service is appreciated but not mandatory like in the US. Credit cards are widely accepted.",
        "Visit major attractions like the Louvre, Eiffel Tower, and Notre Dame (from outside) either right at opening time or in the late afternoon/early evening to avoid the thickest crowds. Always book tickets online in advance when possible.",
        "Learn a few key French phrases: 'Bonjour' (hello), 'Merci' (thank you), 'S'il vous pla\u00eet' (please), 'Pardon' (excuse me/sorry), and 'Parlez-vous anglais?' (Do you speak English?). Even a little effort goes a long way.",
        "Pack comfortable walking shoes! Paris is best explored on foot, and you'll log many miles. Layers are also advisable as the weather can change throughout the day.",
        "Explore beyond the main tourist areas. Discover the charm of neighborhoods like Le Marais or Canal Saint-Martin for unique boutiques, local cafes, and a more authentic Parisian vibe."
