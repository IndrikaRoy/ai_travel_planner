        "When visiting religious sites, always remove your shoes and dress modestly (shoulders and knees covered). Bargaining is expected in local markets for goods and auto-rickshaw fares (if not using apps).",
        "Utilize the Delhi Metro; it's efficient, air-conditioned, and affordable. For cabs and auto-rickshaws, always use ride-sharing apps like Uber or Ola for transparent pricing and safety. Avoid hailing autos directly unless you've negotiated the fare beforehand.",
        "Keep valuables secure, especially in crowded areas like markets and metro stations. Be wary of touts and scammers, particularly around major tourist sites \u2013 if an offer seems too good to be true, it probably is. Stick to reputable guides and vendors.",
        "Indian Rupees (INR) is the currency. While major establishments accept cards, carry smaller denominations for street vendors, small shops, and local transport. ATMs are widely available, but it's wise to inform your bank before international travel.",
        "The best time to visit is from October to March for pleasant weather. Visit popular attractions like India Gate, Qutub Minar, and Humayun's Tomb early morning or late afternoon to avoid peak crowds and the mid-day heat.",
        "Learning a few basic Hindi phrases like \"Namaste\" (hello/goodbye) and \"Dhanyawad\" (thank you) can enhance interactions, though English is widely understood in tourist areas and by most service providers.",
        "Pack light, breathable clothing (cotton/linen) suitable for warm weather for most of the year. For winter (Nov-Feb), bring layers including a light jacket or shawl. Comfortable walking shoes are a must, and women should consider a scarf for modesty at religious sites.",
        "Explore the vibrant street food scene of Old Delhi (Chandni Chowk area) but stick to vendors with high footfall for freshness. Also, consider a heritage walk in areas like Hauz Khas Village or Mehrauli Archaeological Park for a deeper cultural dive beyond the main tourist circuit."
