        "Visit popular attractions like museums, observation decks, and major parks right at opening time or late in the evening to beat the biggest crowds and lines.",
        "Be street smart: keep an eye on your belongings, especially in crowded areas. While generally safe, maintain situational awareness and avoid walking alone late at night in unfamiliar areas.",
        "Venture beyond Manhattan! Explore the unique neighborhoods of Brooklyn (e.g., Williamsburg, Dumbo) or Queens (e.g., Long Island City for stunning skyline views) for diverse culture and food.",
        "Expect a sales tax added to most purchases (currently 8.875% in NYC) that isn't included in the sticker price. Cash is useful for small vendors, but credit cards are widely accepted.",
        "Don't ask for a 'regular coffee' unless you want milk and sugar! Be specific about your order. And definitely try a classic New York bagel and pizza slice."
